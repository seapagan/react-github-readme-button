# Current Bug List

- ~~Does not show local repository images from the readme. Probably need to parse
  any `img` tags and prepend the correct root path which will be :
  <https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/raw/main/{current-img-src}>~~
- ~~same applies to local relative file links~~
- ~~GitHub emojis will not be displayed, this will also be fixed shortly.~~
